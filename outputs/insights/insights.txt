PROJECT INSIGHTS: NETFLIX CONTENT ANALYSIS (1925-2021)

1.  CONTENT STRATEGY (MOVIE vs. TV SHOW)
    Netflix's library is heavily dominated by Movies. Approximately 70% of the content catalog consists of Movies, while TV Shows make up the remaining 30%. This suggests a "movie-first" acquisition and production strategy.

2.  AUDIENCE MATURITY
    The platform primarily caters to an adult audience. The most common content rating on Netflix is 'TV-MA' (Mature Audience), followed by 'TV-14'. This indicates a focus on more mature and complex themes over content for children or general audiences.

3.  CONTENT ACQUISITION BOOM
    Netflix experienced explosive growth between 2017 and 2020. A significant majority of the content currently available was added to the platform during this four-year "streaming boom," showing an aggressive expansion of the library.

4.  GLOBAL CONTENT SOURCING
    While Netflix is a global platform, its content is heavily dominated by the United States. The USA is the top content-producing country by a large margin, with India following as the second-largest contributor, highlighting its focus on the Indian market.

5.  LIBRARY FRESHNESS (RELEASE YEAR)
    The catalog is modern. Most of the content (both movies and TV shows) available on Netflix was originally released after 2010. This shows a clear strategy to prioritize newer titles over classic or older cinema.

6.  POPULAR GENRES
    Globally-focused content and dramas are the most common. 'International Movies' and 'Dramas' are the most frequently listed genres, followed by 'Comedies'.

7.  MOVIE DURATION ANALYSIS
    Netflix movies typically follow the standard feature-film length. The average movie duration is approximately 99 minutes, with the vast majority of films falling between 80 and 120 minutes.
